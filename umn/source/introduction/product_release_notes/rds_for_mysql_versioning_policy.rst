RDS for MySQL Versioning Policy
===============================

RDS for MySQL extends the lifecycle of MySQL Community Edition. New versions are released during the extended period only to fix issues that severely affect the security and stability of DB instances. RDS for MySQL does not promise to fix all major security or stability issues because the MySQL community keeps security information confidential.

RDS for MySQL provides a fully managed database service by leveraging the open-source MySQL. This section describes the versioning policy of RDS for MySQL. When creating a DB instance or migrating data, you need to select a suitable version.
