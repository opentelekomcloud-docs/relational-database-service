Easy Management
===============

Quick Setup
-----------

You can create a DB instance on the management console within minutes and access RDS from an ECS to reduce the application response time and avoid paying for the traffic that would be generated by regular public access.

Elastic Scaling
---------------

Cloud Eye monitors changes in the load on your database and storage capacity. You can flexibly scale resources accordingly and pay for only what you use.

High Compatibility
------------------

You use RDS database engines (DB engines) the same way as you would use a native engine. RDS is compatible with existing programs and tools.

Easy O&M
--------

Routine RDS maintenance and management operations, including hardware and software fault handling and database patch updates, are easy to perform. With the web-based console, you can reboot DB instances, reset passwords, modify parameters, view error or slow query logs, and restore data. Additionally, the system helps you monitor DB instances in real time and generates alarms if an error occurs. You can check DB instance information at any time, including CPU usage, IOPS, database connections, and storage space usage.
