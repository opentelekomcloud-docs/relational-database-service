===================

**Scenarios**

You can set alarm rules by referring to :ref:`Setting Alarm Rules <rds_sqlserver_06_0002__en-us_topic_0192953603_section14765181714318>` to customize the monitored objects and notification policies and keep track of the RDS running status.

The RDS alarm rules include alarm rule names, services, dimensions, monitored objects, metrics, alarm thresholds, monitoring period, and whether to send notifications.
