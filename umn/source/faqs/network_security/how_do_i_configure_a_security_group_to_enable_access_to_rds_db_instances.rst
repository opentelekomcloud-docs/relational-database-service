How Do I Configure a Security Group to Enable Access to RDS DB Instances?
=========================================================================

-  When you attempt to connect to a DB instance through a private network, check whether the ECS and RDS DB instance are in the same security group.

   -  If the ECS and RDS DB instance are in the same security group, they can communicate with each other by default. No security group rules need to be configured.
   -  If the ECS and RDS DB instance are in different security groups, you need to configure security group rules for them, separately.

      -  RDS DB instance: Configure an **inbound** **rule** for the security group with which the DB instance is associated.
      -  ECS: The default security group rule allows all outgoing data packets. In this case, you do not need to configure a security rule for the ECS. If not all outbound traffic is allowed in the security group, you need to configure an **outbound** **rule** for the ECS.

-  When you attempt to connect to a DB instance through an EIP, you need to configure an **inbound rule** for the security group associated with the DB instance.
