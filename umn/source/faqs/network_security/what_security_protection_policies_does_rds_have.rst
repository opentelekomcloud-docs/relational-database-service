What Security Protection Policies Does RDS Have?
================================================

Network
-------

-  RDS runs your DB instances in a VPC, ensuring that the DB instances are isolated from other services.
-  RDS uses security groups to ensure that only trusted sources can access your DB instances.
-  RDS supports SSL connections to encrypt data during transmission.

Management
----------

You can use the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to manage RDS permissions.
