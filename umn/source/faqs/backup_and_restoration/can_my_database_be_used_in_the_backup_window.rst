Can My Database Be Used in the Backup Window?
=============================================

A backup window is a user-specified time during which RDS DB instances are backed up. With these periodic data backups, RDS allows you to restore DB instances to the backups during a retention period. This backup process does not affect services. However, you cannot reboot these DB instances on the RDS console.
