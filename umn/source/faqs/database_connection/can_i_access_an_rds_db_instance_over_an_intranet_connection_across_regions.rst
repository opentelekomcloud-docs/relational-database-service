Can I Access an RDS DB Instance Over an Intranet Connection Across Regions?
===========================================================================

By default, RDS DB instances cannot be accessed over an intranet across regions. Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate with each other over an intranet. You can use Cloud Connect (CC) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect to RDS DB instances across regions.
