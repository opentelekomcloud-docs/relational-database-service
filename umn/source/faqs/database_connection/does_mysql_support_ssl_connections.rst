Does MySQL Support SSL Connections?
===================================

MySQL supports SSL connections. Different from other vendors, RDS for MySQL enables the SSL connection on the database server by default. When you use a client to connect to MySQL DB instances, you can determine whether to enable SSL as required.

For details about SSL, see section :ref:`Connecting to an RDS for MySQL DB Instance Through a Public Network <rds_02_0048>`.
