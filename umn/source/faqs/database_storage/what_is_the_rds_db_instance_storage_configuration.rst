What Is the RDS DB Instance Storage Configuration?
==================================================

RDS uses Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks for storage. For details about EVS disks, see *Elastic Volume Service Product Introduction*.

The RDS backup data is stored in OBS and does not occupy the database storage space. For details on the RDS DB instance storage configuration, see the *Object Storage Service User Guide*.
