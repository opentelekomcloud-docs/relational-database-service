What Should I Do If My Data Exceeds the Available Storage of an RDS DB Instance?
================================================================================

Scenario
--------

There is not enough storage available for an RDS DB instance and the DB instance has entered read-only status, or applications can no longer read from or write to the databases, interrupting services.

Causes
------

Possible causes include:

-  Too much data being stored.
-  Too many MySQL binlog files being generated due to a large number of transactions and write operations.
-  A large number of temporary files being generated due to a large number of sorting queries executed by applications.

Solution
--------

#. If your DB instance becomes read-only because there is too much data, contact technical support to cancel the read-only status and run statements to delete useless historical table data to free up space. To delete data of an entire table, run **DROP** or **TRUNCATE**. To delete part of table data, run **DELETE** and **OPTIMIZE TABLE**. If the instance still supports read and write operations, directly delete unless historical table data. If no historical data can be deleted, scale up your storage space.
#. If MySQL binlog files are taking up too much space, contact technical support to delete local binlog files to free up storage space.
#. If temporary files generated by sorting queries are taking up too much space, optimize your SQL query statements.
#. If none of these solutions work, use database and table sharding.
