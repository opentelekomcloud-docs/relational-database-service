Changing the Read/Write Splitting Address
=========================================

Scenarios
---------

After read/write splitting is enabled, you can change the read/write splitting address.

Precautions
-----------

Changing the read/write splitting address will interrupt database connections and services. Therefore, change the read/write splitting address during off-peak hours or when services are stopped.

Constraints
-----------

The new IP address is not in use and must be in the same subnet as the RDS for MySQL instance.
