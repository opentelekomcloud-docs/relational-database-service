Stopping an Instance
====================

Function
--------

This API is used to stop a pay-per-use DB instance. The instance can be stopped for up to seven days.

-  Before calling an API, you need to understand the API in :ref:`Authentication <rds_03_0001>`.
-  Before calling this API, obtain the required `region and endpoint <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.

Constraints
-----------

-  This API is supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL DB engines.

-  If you stop a primary instance, read replicas (if there are any) will also be stopped. They are stopped for up to seven days. You cannot stop a read replica without stopping the primary instance.

-  A stopped MySQL DB instance will not be moved to the recycle bin after being deleted.

-  A stopped PostgreSQL DB instance cannot be deleted.

-  If you do not manually start your stopped DB instance after seven days, your DB instance is automatically started during the next maintenance window.

-  After an instance is stopped, the ECS is no longer billed. Other resources, including EIPs, storage resources, and backups, are still billed.

-  An instance cannot be stopped if it is in any of the following statuses:

   Creating, rebooting, scaling up, changing instance class, restoring, and changing port
